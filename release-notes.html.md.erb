#### Integrate custom user avatar provider

We have provided the possibility to use custom avatar provider services, other than Gravatar.

#### Improved app handling over UI

We have made two improvements to ensure that the Developer Console matches more smoothly to operations on apps performed over the CLI.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version v239 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v239)) with Diego version v0.1481.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1481.0)).
**Known Issue**: If an application has a lot of env variables(threshold tbd), which can happen if there are more than 40 services attached, the application is not able to start.
Besides many other improvements, the CF update includes the fix for [CVE-2016-5006: Cloud Controller API logs user-provided service credentials](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-5006), which caused user provided service credentials to appear in the cloud controller logs. This security issue was at no time critical for Swisscom's customers, as the Cloud Foundry internal logs are in a secured environment.

### Services

### Billing and Portal

#### Backup and restore for MariaDB service instances

Backup and restore of your MariaDB instances can now be performed through the Developer Console. On MariaDB service instances the user has a new tab for creating, restoring and deleting backups for that particular instance. Handling of the backup data is managed in a fully automated and transparent manner.

#### Billing improvements

We improved the way we bill products in two important cases: firstly we now detect when an app is stopped an pause billing during the time the app is not running and secondly we have made our processing more robust when dealing with the deletion of a product.

#### Improved SSL self-service feature

We have added a number of improvements for the SSL self-service feature. On one hand we have provided more guidance to the user and on the other hand we have extended the detail view for SSL certificates in the Developer Console to include all V3 extensions.

#### Improved default apps

We have improved the default app for static files to include values of environment variables like all of the other default apps. Furthermore, we have adapted the PHP default app to display its Environment Variables in a way consistent with the other default apps.

#### Changed rules for resending invitations

Invitations can now be resent, if they were rejected.

#### Improved space role handling for non-managers

A user who is not manager of a space can now also remove roles for himself / herself. This was previously not permitted.

#### Enabled pushing of docker images over Developer Console

Docker images can now be pushed directly over the Developer Console. This was previously only possible via the CLI.

#### Usability improvements in Developer Console

We are constantly improving the usability of the Developer Console based on customer feedback as well as regular usability tests. In particular, we have improved the graph explaining the structure of an account, we have added syntax highlighting on code snippets and we have improved the quick search shortcut on Mac(⌘+k).

## <a id='3.1.9'></a> 3.1.9

### Billing and Portal

#### Improved default apps

We have made improvements to the default apps which are pushed in the Developer Console, if no app code is provided.

### Services

Update orchestration framework, should make single service instance provisioning slightly faster
Various other stability fixes in service management

Backup and restore of MongoDB single instances with up to 30 backups per service instance.

New DNS setup that fixes issues with temporary unresolvable services.

### Billing and Portal

#### Backup and restore for MongoDB service instances

Backup and restore of your MongoDB instances can now be performed through the Developer Console. On MongoDB service instances the user has a new tab for creating, restoring and deleting backups for that particular instance. Handling of the backup data is managed in a fully automated and transparent manner.

#### Extended quota management

We have extended the possibilities for managing quotas at org and space level. Organization quotas can now be assigned by users with organization manager permissions over the API. Furthermore, space quotas can be viewed in the Developer Console in an analogous way to organization quotas.

#### Improved handling for invitations

We have improved the way the users can handle their invitations. In particular, when the user follows the link to the Developer Console in an invitation email, the invitation is displayed in a modal, as soon as the user reaches the Developer Console.

#### Improved API performance when querying permissions

Permissions are typically queried heavily by UI clients which consume our API, like the Developer Console itself. To the benefit of such clients, we have improved the performance of the permissions endpoints on our API.

#### Improved display of certificates

The list of certificates in the sidebar of the space details has been reworked to improve readability by allowing the user to toggle the display of revoked certificates.

#### UI redesign extended to more screens

We have continued our effort to streamline the UI of the developer console. To this end we have made some stylistic changes to the push app wizard and to the app details screen.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version 233 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v233)) with Diego version 0.1461.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1461.0)):

- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0781 UAA Persistent XSS Vulnerability. The UAA OAuth approval pages are vulnerable to an XSS attack by specifying malicious java script content in either the OAuth scopes (SCIM groups) or SCIM group descriptions.
- v233 also includes a fix for CVE-2016-2165 - Loggregator Request URL Paths. 404 responses from Loggregator endpoints include the URL sent, and are vulnerable to an XSS attack.
- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0780 Cloud Controller Disk Quota Enforcement. It was discovered that Cloud Foundry does not properly enforce disk quotas in certain cases. An attacker could use an improper disk quota value to bypass enforcement and consume all the disk on DEAs/Diego Cells causing a potential denial of service for other applications.
- v233 has a potential for only delivering partial sets of log messages for an app, or to the firehose. This can happen if multiple Dopplers have restarted since the Traffic Controllers were deployed. If you suspect you are missing logs, the workaround is to restart the Traffic Controllers.
- v233 contains a performance regression in Gorouter introduced in v228. At low request volume, the issue is not observable; only at higher request volumes (such as a load test) is the regression evident. The regression was fixed in v234.
- v233 includes a change in cflinuxfs2 that removes support for libmysqlclient in favor of libmariadb. This will require a clearing of buildpack cache and a restaging of apps for the changes to take place.
