title: Two-Factor Authentication
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

If you enable Passeport's two-factor authentication, you have to use the `--sso` flag and follow the instructions.

<pre class="terminal">
cf login -a $API_ENDPOINT --sso
API endpoint: $API_ENDPOINT

One Time Code ( $API_ENDPOINT/passcode )>
</pre>

Replace `$API_ENDPOINT` with your actial API endpoint. It is <%= vars.api_endpoint %>

Switching to the browser and obtaining a one time code is needed because the cf CLI does not support two-factor auth directly from the terminal yet.
